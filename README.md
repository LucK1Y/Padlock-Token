# Padlock Token Project

# Overview
This project deals with the implementation of a locking mechanism.
It goal is to replace the traditionally implemented solution with hardware keys and locks with the **block chain** technology. 
The goal of this work is to create a technology with which conventional locks can be replaced.

# Facts
This project is only a prototype in early stages.
Therefore, it rather gives an idea of a solution than the actual solution.  
This project was implemented by students in the context of a block chain lecture at the **DHBW Stuttgart**.

The Solution is based on a smart contract written in solidity.
Two separate frontend can both interact with the smart contract.
